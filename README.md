Frontend: Javascript, vanilla CSS and React.
Backend: Express and MongoDB.

Setup:
Install Node.js - run npm install in both /backend and /frontend.

Install MongoDb - Once installed run mongod in terminal to start, this will start the database at: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017

Start the backend Server: "npm start" from /backend
Start the frontend Server: "npm start" from /frontend

Open your broswer and navigate to: http://localhost:5173

Should you want to deploy the project in production then some sensitive data should be moved to a .ENV file.

Final Note:
I only found the job posting on Saturday 26th, so the project has been completed with limited time available, I hope that this does not reduce my chances of interview, thank you for your time in reviewing this.
